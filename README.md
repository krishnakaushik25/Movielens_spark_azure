# Movielens dataset analysis for movie recommendations using Spark in Azure


## Description

A movie recommendation system is used by top streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Hotstar etc to recommend movies to their users based on historical viewing patterns.

Before the final recommendation is made, there is a complex data pipeline that brings data from many sources to the recommendation engine. In this project, we use Databricks Spark on Azure with Spark Sql to build this data pipeline.


Our dataset is from GroupLens Research, which is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. They operate a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering called MovieLens. 

This dataset (ml-25m) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. 

### Recommendations
1. Recently Watched
2. Highest genre rated by user
3. Latest Trending
